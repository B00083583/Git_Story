<h1>
    When I was 7 years old my mum left us to work abroad in Ireland.
    It wasn’t the best feeling when one of your parents leave you behind.
    I was still a kid and didn’t really know how to feel or act and all I can
    remember that time is that I was crying.
    My mum always call us through skype every weekend and talk to her, ask her
    how she is and all that. She would normally send us chocolates or clothes every few months or so.
    Chocolate doesn’t exist in my country unless you’re rich and can buy everything.
    We were just in the middle in the category of rich and poor.

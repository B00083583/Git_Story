<h1>
    When I was 7 years old my mum left us to work abroad in Ireland.
    It wasn’t the best feeling when one of your parents leave you behind.
    I was still a kid and didn’t really know how to feel or act and all I can
    remember that time is that I was crying.
    My mum always call us through skype every weekend and talk to her, ask her
    how she is and all that. She would normally send us chocolates or clothes every few months or so.
    Things get easier as months go by as my grandma and my aunt and my other cousins lives with us.
    When I was 10 years old it was my dad that left us, and went off to Ireland.
    I was still a kid but can feel the sadness that both of my parents are far away.
    They were obviously doing it for myself and my
    other siblings but I just didn’t realise it at the time.
    It was tough having no parents and just your relatives with you all
    the time but you know being kids you just buy them a few toys and their content with their lives.

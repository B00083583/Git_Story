<h1>
    It have been about 5 years since both of my parents left us but now its myself and my brothers to move and fly to Ireland.
    As a kid at the age of 11 leaving my country was really hard. all of my relatives, friends and cousins I’m leaving behind I will miss them.
    At the same time I was scared as it was my first time being in an aeroplane.

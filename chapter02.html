    <title>Moving to Ireland</title>

<h1>
    It have been about 5 years since both of my parents left us but now its myself and my brothers to move and fly to Ireland.
    As a kid at the age of 11 leaving my country was really hard. all of my relatives, friends and cousins I’m leaving behind I will miss them.
    At the same time I was scared as it was my first time being in an aeroplane.
    I wasn’t alone I was with my mam and with my two other brothers.
    All that I can remember from the 22 hour flight that if felt like my entire life just being on the plane
    for 12 hours then a stopover in Abu Dhabi for a few hours and then leave Abu Dhabi to Ireland which is another 8 or hours so.
    The journey felt really long.
    When we arrived at the airport there was a big chnage because some of the signs were on irish and i
    wasnt sure what they meant. my english werent bad at the time but still learning it. One of the big change i notice was the color of people.
    i was at the age of 12 so i was fascinated seeing other people(white or black) brown for me was wasnt always a big color or tan as most
    people in my country where tan or brown and so am i.

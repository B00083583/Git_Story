</head>
<body>

<h1>
    After a few weeks living in ireland, my dad decided it was a good idea to bring us at a summer camp for a week. Basically for one whole
    week we just play games, meet new kids, make some friends and enjoy the last few weeks of summer before my first day fo school will start.
    I thought it was a good idea but its just that i wasnt really confident with my english at the time and and sometimes i wasnt sure
    what the camp leaders where saying to me. At the end of the week myself and my brother survived, we made new friends and had a really fun
    week.

<h2>
    A few weeks have gone by and school is just around the corner. Myself, my brother and my mom went shopping to buy school supplies for
    school. we bought books and basically youre essentiall things like youre pencil,rubber,pens and crayons.
    Then the big day came, its School day.!

<h3>
    It was a big day for myself and my brother and so as for my parents as it was out first day at school in ireland. My parents brought us
    to the school waited for us till we got inside. When we are inside the teachers introduced themselves and one by one each students or
    my classmates introduced themselves also. I also obviously introduced myself as well. my little brother who was in a different grade,
    as i was in 6th and he was in 3rd. I was worried for him because his just by himself and unlike me i have my other twin to support me.

    <title>Summer Camp and First Day of School</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>
    After a few weeks living in ireland, my dad decided it was a good idea to bring us at a summer camp for a week. Basically for one whole
    week we just play games, meet new kids, make some friends and enjoy the last few weeks of summer before my first day fo school will start.
    I thought it was a good idea but its just that i wasnt really confident with my english at the time and and sometimes i wasnt sure
    what the camp leaders where saying to me. At the end of the week myself and my brother survived, we made new friends and had a really fun
    week.

<h2>
    A few weeks have gone by and school is just around the corner. Myself, my brother and my mom went shopping to buy school supplies for
    school. we bought books and basically youre essentiall things like youre pencil,rubber,pens and crayons.
    Then the big day came, its School day.!
</h2>

<h3>
    It was a big day for myself and my brother and so as for my parents as it was out first day at school in ireland. My parents brought us
    to the school waited for us till we got inside. When we are inside the teachers introduced themselves and one by one each students or
    my classmates introduced themselves also. I also obviously introduced myself as well. my little brother who was in a different grade,
    as i was in 6th and he was in 3rd. I was worried for him because his just by himself and unlike me i have my other twin to support me.

<h4>
    After all introcuctioned is done, we started off easy that day as i can remember, We didnt do much just talk to youre neighbour and get
    to know them, learned a little bit of english and maths but then boom! the teacher said "okay guys we will learn a little bit of irish today"
    that threw me off because i dont know what irish is at the time and who? or what it is. Then my teacher explaine that studnet who only
    came to ireland or didnt start school in ireland is excempted. I was a bit worried atm but after hearing that i didnt have to do irish
    for the whole year was good and basically during irish class we are sent to a different room to learn more about english. There were a few
    of us who were excempted from irish so myself and my brother werent alone.

<h5>
    After the end of school my mum picked us up and asked us how our first day was, I remembered replying to her " it was good, different,
    the way they tought us and basically everythings in english. This day was the start of my life in Ireland.

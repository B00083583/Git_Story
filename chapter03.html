    <title>Summer Camp and First Day of School</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>
    After a few weeks living in ireland, my dad decided it was a good idea to bring us at a summer camp for a week. Basically for one whole
    week we just play games, meet new kids, make some friends and enjoy the last few weeks of summer before my first day fo school will start.
    I thought it was a good idea but its just that i wasnt really confident with my english at the time and and sometimes i wasnt sure
    what the camp leaders where saying to me. At the end of the week myself and my brother survived, we made new friends and had a really fun
    week.

    A few weeks have gone by and school is just around the corner. Myself, my brother and my mom went shopping to buy school supplies for
    school. we bought books and basically youre essentiall things like youre pencil,rubber,pens and crayons.
    Then the big day came, its School day.!

<h1>
    So now After finishing Primary school and Secondary School. Ive been living in Ireland for about 8 years now and this country has been everything to me and now moving to the big world 
    going to college. When i started first year it was grand, everything is good but at the same time college is hard and i know it wouldnt get easier every year.
    Now im currently in Third year studying the same course, havent dropped out yet. things just get tougher at this stage. I feel like ive been scraping every module just for a pass
    as i feel like everything seems quite hard. hopefully things will change.
</h1>

<h2>
   This is the last year, now in third year things is just a little bit stressful with all the lot of work we have been giving from the first semester and now its the second semster 
    things just dont come easy in this course. Im just hoping that i pass everything and do well on my CA's and on my exams this May.
